### A Matlab toolbox for problem solving

#### Uses
This toolbox should be able to:
* solve most equations at an undergrad level
* help in mathematically phrasing most problems
* generate classic demonstrations seen in class

#### How to install
You can download the zip or clone the repo.  
Then, add it to your path or navigate to it from within Matlab.  
It will find any necessary files for your project by itself.  
Just launch the main.m script and follow the instructions.
